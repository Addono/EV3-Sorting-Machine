\section{Summary}
The design of the software specifies which functions are needed. The functions are grouped based on function, for each group it is specified which other groups they are allowed to call \longref{software-design:structure}. Every group of functions has multiple functions already worked out in pseudo-code, to create a guideline for the general structure of the functions in that group, to aid the implementation during the \seeref{software-implementation}.
