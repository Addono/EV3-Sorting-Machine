\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, we have now stated the requirements of the machine. We have shown the use-cases, so what the machine should be able to do in different cases. We have noted the user constraints and explained the safety properties and finally we have defined the machine interface.

A video of the workings of the machine can be seen in the following link: \href{https://goo.gl/BG1Xey}{https://goo.gl/BG1Xey}.
