\section{Summary}
In this phase we define the design of our software, the software is based upon a Finite State Automaton. Since the EV3's input and output comes from or goes to multiple different sensors we split them into multiple groups. The FSA is based on a Mealy machine, and uses the input and current state to define the output and next state. Afterwards UPPAAL was used to proof the correctness of the FSA.
