\section{Summary}
% Reading the Project Guide
This phase started with orientating on the requirements and the flow of the project by reading and making abstracts of the Project Guide (\autoref{orientation:orientation:abstract}).
% Divide roles and tasks.
When we had a sufficient idea about the way the project was intended to be executed we started with the \seeref{orientation:work-plan}. This includes defining and distributing the roles of president, secretary, quality insurance manager, the author responsible for each phase, and the time schedule for the project itself and the deliverables. \par
% Physical introduction to the EV3
For everyone who is not familiar with the EV3, there is a not too in-depth overview \seeref{orientation:ev3} mostly about the physical aspects, the software side is covered in \seeref{implementation:lejos}.
