Upcoming chapters document each phase of the development process. This summary consists of a brief notion about what to expect in each phase. The first phase is the Orientation which describes how the project was intended to be executed. All the roles have been distributed for the whole period, a schedule was set and a date for every deliverable was put. Also, a description of the EV3 is in this phase.

The Machine Design phase describes the physical implementation of the sorting machine, its requirements, use-cases, user-constraints, safety properties and the interface. It also contains a walk-through of all the design decisions we have made.

The Software Specification phase describes the design of our software, which is base on a Finite State Automaton. The correctness is proven using UPPAAL.

The Software Design phase describes what functions are needed and the functions of each of these.

In the last construction phase, the Software Implementation and Integration, the software designed in the previous phase is translated in Java using the leJOS library.

The System Validation and Testing phase is used to test the functionality of our machine. Code review were made and we tested everything and described every test in the test cases. It also describes the proof that was made using UPPAAL.
