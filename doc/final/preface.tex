This technical report describes a sorting machine developed over the course of 8 weeks by Group 2 for the course 2IO70 DBL: Embedded Systems. This is a technical document written to explain the process of creating this embedded system, the sorting machine. This manual is intended towards everybody who wants to see how we developed the machine for this course.

This text uses one text convention. In the orientation phase, Italics are used to identify the names of the persons responsible for the different things that need to be done. In all the other phases, the same text convention was used to identify key-words in sentences.

The assignment that was given to us was to construct and program a machine that sorts 12 disks depending on their color(black or white). Given that we were one of the trail groups that had the chance to work with the EV3 processor, we decided to not only sort the disks, but also implement a lot of error detection and additional features.
